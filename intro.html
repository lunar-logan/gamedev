                        Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.[1] Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. In mathematics, "spaces" are examined with different numbers of dimensions and with different underlying structures.                    </p>

                        <h1>Objective</h1>
                        The main object of the game would be a spaceship which is bound to run into an infinite universe.The motion of the spaceship can be controlled by both touch buttons on the screen/through motion sensing by the accelerometer.The spaceship would encounter obstacles in its way such as asteroids , meteors , planets etc.The exciting part of the game is the levels which will be implemented in it , i.e the speed of the spaceship would increase constantly as we cover a larger distance escaping the obstacles.

                        There would be a global points table which will get updated when different players play in different machines.A small database would be made based upon the scores and user can fetch his/her rank anytime through requests.

                        We are planning to code the game logic and graphics in OpenGL and Java.We may use Game Engines such as Unity 3D/JMonkey to add certain functionality and robust graphics to our game.Through this project we want to build confidence in the game development part of software engineering which undoubtedly is of great advantage in todayâ€™s game-addicted world.
